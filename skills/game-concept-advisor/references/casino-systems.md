## Core Gambling Mechanics

### The Betting Triangle

```
                 STAKES
                   ▲
                  ╱ ╲
                 ╱   ╲         Higher stakes = more emotion
                ╱     ╲        But also more risk aversion
               ╱       ╲
              ╱    FUN  ╲
             ╱           ╲
            ╱─────────────╲
        ODDS ───────────── CONTROL

ODDS: "What's my chance of winning?"
STAKES: "How much am I risking?"
CONTROL: "Can I influence the outcome?"

Perfect gambling fun = Balance all three
Too high stakes = Anxiety
Too low stakes = Boredom
No control = Slot machine (not for everyone)
Full control = Not gambling, just strategy
```

## Psychological Design

### The Near Miss

```
NEAR MISS PSYCHOLOGY
────────────────────
• Almost winning feels like winning
• Creates "next time" anticipation
• Encourages continued play
• Must be used ethically

ETHICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
• Near misses should provide partial rewards
• Don't manufacture artificial near misses
• Celebrate near misses as progress
• Don't use to manipulate spending

FARMING IN PURRIA:
├─ Pot reaches 48% (threshold 50%)
├─ Display: "SO CLOSE! Just 2% more!"
├─ Award small consolation prize
├─ Near miss counts toward achievement
└─ Feels like progress, not failure
```

### Variable Ratio Reinforcement

```
REINFORCEMENT SCHEDULES
───────────────────────
• Fixed ratio: Every Nth action rewards (predictable)
• Variable ratio: Average N actions (unpredictable)
• Variable ratio = highest engagement
• But must be used responsibly

ETHICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
• Core progression uses fixed ratios (predictable)
• Bonus rewards use variable ratios (exciting)
• Never tie real money to variable rewards
• Transparent about odds

FARMING IN PURRIA:
├─ Daily rewards: Fixed (always get something)
├─ Pot wins: Variable (depends on game state)
├─ Bonus events: Variable (pleasant surprises)
├─ Core progression: Fixed (reliable growth)
└─ Mix creates engagement without exploitation
```

### Loss Aversion

```
LOSS AVERSION PSYCHOLOGY
────────────────────────
• Losing hurts 2× more than winning feels good
• Players are risk-averse when ahead
• Players are risk-seeking when behind
• Losses feel personal, wins feel external

DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
• Minimize loss feeling (lose "chances," not "resources")
• Frame losses as investments
• Recovery mechanics after losses
• Never punish too harshly

FARMING IN PURRIA:
├─ Losses: "Pot didn't fill" (missed opportunity)
├─ Not: "You lost your coins" (taken from you)
├─ Recovery: "Comeback bonus" after bad day
├─ Framing: "Today's investment, tomorrow's growth"
└─ Emotional language matters enormously
```

### The Gambler's Fallacy

```
GAMBLER'S FALLACY
─────────────────
• "I've lost 5 times, so I'm due to win"
• Independent events don't affect each other
• But patterns feel meaningful to humans

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
• Can subvert or leverage this
• Streak systems feel "fair" even if random
• Pity timers prevent long bad streaks
• Balance mathematical fairness with emotional fairness

FARMING IN PURRIA:
├─ Pity timer: After 5 losses, boost odds slightly
├─ Not mathematically necessary, emotionally kind
├─ Streaks: Acknowledge both win and loss streaks
├─ Win streak bonus feels earned
├─ Loss streak sympathy feels compassionate
└─ Emotion-aware design
```

## Loyalty & Retention Systems

### Tier Systems

```
TIER STRUCTURE
──────────────
• Entry tier (everyone starts here)
• Achievement tiers (earned through play)
• Soft decay (maintains engagement)
• Permanent recognition (never feel demoted)

FARMING IN PURRIA:

"Farmer Prestige"
├─ Seedling (new players)
├─ Sprout (played 1 season)
├─ Gardener (completed seasons, good scores)
├─ Horticulturist (mastery achievements)
├─ Master Cultivator (elite status)
└─ Each tier: Permanent cosmetics + soft benefits
```

### Points Currencies

```
CURRENCY TYPES
──────────────
• Soft currency (freely earned, spent on basics)
• Hard currency (rare, premium purchases)
• Loyalty currency (earned by time, spent on status)
• Event currency (temporary, creates urgency)

FARMING IN PURRIA:

"Multi-Currency Economy"
├─ Coins: Primary, earned through play
├─ Tulip Bulbs: Rare, from successful harvests
├─ Prestige Points: From achievements, for cosmetics
├─ Season Tokens: Event currency, season-specific rewards
└─ Clear purpose for each, no confusion
```

### Streak Systems

```
STREAK DESIGN
─────────────
• Reward consecutive engagement
• Soft: Miss a day, lose streak but get partial credit
• Hard: Miss a day, restart from zero
• Combo: Streak builds faster, breaks slower

ETHICAL STREAK DESIGN:
• Never punish absence
• Reward presence instead
• Allow streak "freeze" or "vacation mode"
• Soft catch-up for returning players

FARMING IN PURRIA:

"Growth Streak"
├─ Day 1: Base bonus
├─ Day 2-3: +10% bonus
├─ Day 4-7: +25% bonus
├─ Day 8+: +50% bonus
├─ Miss a day: Reset to +10% (not zero)
├─ Miss 3+ days: Reset to base
├─ Returning bonus: "Welcome back! Here's a gift"
└─ Encourages without guilt
```

## Monetization Ethics

### Fair Monetization

```
ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
──────────────────
• Never sell advantage
• Never sell time skip for core content
• Cosmetics and convenience only
• Transparent odds always
• No "pay to not be annoyed"
• Respect player time and money

FARMING IN PURRIA:

"Acceptable Monetization"
├─ Cosmetic Simulin skins
├─ Farm decoration themes
├─ Additional save slots
├─ Name change tokens
├─ "Support the devs" bundles (pure cosmetic)
└─ Battle pass (cosmetics + minor bonuses)

"Unacceptable Monetization"
├─ Extra lives or retries
├─ Pay to skip timers
├─ Loot boxes with unknown odds
├─ Pay for competitive advantage
├─ Pay to remove intentional annoyances
└─ Anything that makes non-payers feel bad
```

### Social Casino Ethics

```
SOCIAL CASINO DEFINITION
────────────────────────
• No real money gambling
• Virtual currency only
• Can't cash out
• Entertainment, not financial instrument

FARMING IN PURRIA:
├─ Coins have no real value
├─ Cannot purchase coins directly for money
├─ Cannot convert coins to money
├─ Clearly labeled as entertainment
├─ Age-appropriate (no simulated real gambling)
└─ Fun of gambling without the harm
```
