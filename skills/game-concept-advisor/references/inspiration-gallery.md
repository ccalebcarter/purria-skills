## Innovation Principles

### How to Generate New Ideas

```
1. CONSTRAINT + FREEDOM
   Define tight constraints, then explore freely within them
   "What if we could only add ONE new mechanic?"

2. OPPOSITE DAY
   Take a mechanic and reverse it
   "What if winning a bet was bad sometimes?"

3. STEAL + TWIST
   Take from another game, add your unique spin
   "Poker, but the cards are tulips"

4. PLAYER DESIRE
   Start from what players want to feel
   "I want players to feel like garden wizards"

5. PROBLEM AS FEATURE
   Take a problem and make it a mechanic
   "Waiting is boring → Waiting is betting time"

6. CROSS-POLLINATE
   Combine unrelated domains
   "What if tulip breeding worked like Pokémon evolution?"

7. SIMPLIFY UNTIL ELEGANT
   Remove until you can't remove more
   "What if the whole game was just betting on pots?"
```

### The "Yes, And" Method

```
Start with a seed idea, build on it:

SEED: "Simulins could have moods"

YES, AND: "...moods affect their efficiency"
YES, AND: "...you can improve moods with gifts"
YES, AND: "...gifts are crafted from tulip by-products"
YES, AND: "...this creates a gift economy"
YES, AND: "...Simulins remember gifts across seasons"
YES, AND: "...long-term Simulin relationships unlock abilities"

NOW EVALUATE:
• Is this fun? (Probably!)
• Is this feasible? (Moderate complexity)
• Does it fit? (Enhances Simulin attachment)
```
